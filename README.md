## Problem Title
#### SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms



## Problem Description

### Background

Biosecurity forms the foundation of animal health management in pig and poultry sectors. Disease outbreaks such as African Swine Fever (ASF) and Avian Influenza pose catastrophic economic threats, causing estimated losses exceeding ₹5,000 crores annually in India's livestock sector.
Smallholder farmers, who constitute 78% of India's livestock base, lack access to practical biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and compliance frameworks. This digital divide exacerbates disease transmission, threatening food security and rural livelihoods across India.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Problem Statement  

Current biosecurity management relies on outdated manual processes, fragmented information sources, and lack of real-time monitoring. Farmers struggle with:
Inconsistent implementation of biosecurity protocols Delayed disease outbreak notifications
Poor record-keeping for regulatory compliance Limited access to expert guidance in local languages
Inability to predict disease risks based on local epidemiological conditions

### Expected Outcomes

######  1.90% farmer adoption of digital biosecurity practices within 24 months

######  2.50% reduction in disease outbreak incidents through early detection

######  3.Certified compliance with international biosecurity standards

######  4.40% faster disease outbreak response by authorities

######  5.Empowerment of 500,000+ smallholder farmers with actionable intelligence

######  6.Real-time surveillance data for policy makers and government agencies
